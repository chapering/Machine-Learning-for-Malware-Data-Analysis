Preparation
Particularly, for tracking concept drift, an additional python module 'statsmodels' is needed.
To track concept drift in malware family, first, it is necessary to have malware and benign feature files with proper method (Drebin, CSBD, etc.). All the feature files should contain time stamp and family information in their names.
Note that, for Temporal Similarity Measure, one Vocabulary file for certain family is required. The Vocabulary file can be generated by 'GetTopVocab.py', the command line argument is like following:
python GetTopVocab.py <Malware Feature Files Dir> <Goodware Feature Files Dir> <Family Name> <Feature File Extension>
By running the program above, it will generated one vocabulary file ('Familyname_*.txt) and one weight vector file ('Familyname_*_Weight.txt').


Usage of Temporal Similarity Measure
python TemporalSimilarity.py <Feature Files Dir> <Family Name> <Feature File Extension>	


Usage of Meta-feature Measure
python Meta-feature.py <Feature Files Dir> <Family Name> <Feature File Extension>	


Usage of Retraining Performance Measure
python RetrainingPerformance.py <Malware Feature Files Dir> <Goodware Feature Files Dir> <Family Name> <Feature File Extension> <Window Size> <Growing Window Option>
  Note that Window Size is a float between 0 and 1, which is the percentage used for train the classifier without retraining.
  Growing Window is a number of 1 or 0, where 1 represents using growing window, 0 for no. Growing Window is used for retraining, i.e. the retraining set keeps growing to the date.
