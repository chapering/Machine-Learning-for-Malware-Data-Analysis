*Note that according to the Pedal paper, a non-linear kernal of SVM is used as the classifier, therefore, top feature dumping parts are omitted here.
*If there is a need, you can change the model to linear in the 'Pedal_Training.py', and open the comment portions.

Feature Extraction
The command line argument of generating PEDAL features is:
python Pedal_Extractor.py <App Dir>	
  Here the Directory of app is the root directory of apps, PEDAL will go into all the subfolders of given directory.
The output of Pedal_Extractor.py are feature files for each pkg stored in current folder.


Build Vocabulary and Model
The command line argument of building PEDAL model is:
python Pedal_Training.py <Ad Pkg Feature Files Dir> <Non-Ad Pkg Feature Files Dir> <Features Files Extension> <Feature Combination>
  Here the Directory of Ad/Non-Ad Pkg Feature Files is the root directory of PEDAL features, PEDAL will go into all the subfolders of given directory.
  The Extension of feature files is usually '.Features'.
  The Feature Combination option is a binary number sequence. The first digit represents Basic Component features, '1' means these features are included while '0' is excluded. Similarly, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th digit represent Permission features, Visual Element features, SUSI Category API features, Runtime Permission Check features and Keyword features respectively.
The output the Pedal_Training.py are 'TrainingReport.txt' which indicates the model performance and top features; 'Model.pkl' which is the best classifier model and 'Vocab.txt' which is the classifier's vocabulary.


Test on Single App
The command line argument of testing apps with PEDAL model is:
python Pedal_Training.py <App Dir> <Model Path> <Vocabulary Path> <Feature Combination>
  Here the Directory of apps is the root directory of apps to be detected, PEDAL will go into all the subfolders of given directory.
For a given app named abc.apk, the output of are detected Ad Lib list for this app in 'abc.apk_AdLib.txt' (and top features for each pkg named as '*_TopFeas.txt').
