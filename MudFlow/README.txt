Configuration
To use MUDFLOW, it is necessary to edit configure file of MUDFLOW correctly first in 'Mudflow/MudFlowConfig.txt'.
  The 'NumFlowProcesses' in this file is the maximum processes used for FlowDroid, consider that FlowDroid is very memory & time consuming, this number is suggested to be 5 for normal usage (can be larger for high computing capability systems).
  The 'MaxRam' is the maximum usage for EACH process.
  The 'Timeout' is the maximum timeout for EACH process, if one process runs beyond the timeout, it will be killed automatically, which will lead to a failure in data flow extraction.
  The 'Platformpath' is the location/path of Android Platform Environments, FlowDroid uses resources of Android platforms to analyze the app. Note that the platform folder should be up to date since Android OS keeps updating.


Feature Extraction
The command line argument of generating MUDFLOW features is:
python MudFlow.py <Malware App Dir> <Goodware App Dir> <Feature Granularity>
  Here the Directory of Malware or Goodware is the root directory of apps, MudFlow will go into all the subfolders of given directory.
  The Feature Granularity option is a binary number sequence. '100' represents category features only; '010' represents class features only; '001' represents method features only. The option can also be a combination of different granularities, like '111' represents all 3 levels features combination, etc.
The output of MudFlow.py will be put into 2 folders: 'Metadata' and 'Data'. All Log files of FlowDroid are inside 'MetaData/', while all MudFlow Feature Files are in 'Data/'.


Classification
The classification of MudFlow is done in MudFlow.py, the default train_test split is 0.3, the result of classification can be found in 'ClassificationReport.txt' in 'Data/'
