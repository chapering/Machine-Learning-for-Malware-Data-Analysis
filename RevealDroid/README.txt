Configuration
To use RevealDroid, it is also necessary to edit configure file of FlowDroid correctly first in 'RevealDroid/FlowDroidConfig.txt'.
  The 'NumFlowProcesses' in this file is the maximum processes used for FlowDroid. Note that this number is not the number in the command argument introduced below.
  The 'MaxRam' is the maximum usage for EACH process.
  The 'Timeout' is the maximum timeout for EACH process, if one process runs beyond the timeout, it will be killed automatically, which will lead to a failure in data flow extraction.
  The 'Platformpath' is the location/path of Android Platform Environments.


Feature Extraction
The command line argument of generating RevealDroid features is:
python RevealDroid.py <Malware App Dir> <Goodware App Dir> <Num of Processes> <Feature Combination>
  Here the Directory of Malware or Goodware is the root directory of apps, RevealDroid will go into all the subfolders of given directory. 
  RevealDroid employs multi-processing to boost the feature generation, this process number are assigned to generate API & Intent Action Features which are not memory-consuming, hence this argument can be given a relatively large number (e.g., the number of CPUs).
  The Feature Combination option is a binary number sequence, default option is '1111'. The first digit represents API features, '1' means API features are included while '0' is excluded. Similarly, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th digit represent FLOW features, IA features and PAPI features respectively.


Standard Output
The output of RevealDroid.py will be put into 2 folders: 'Metadata' and 'Data'. All FlowDroid Log files, and other 3 types of feature files are separately extracted and stored inside 'MetaData/'; Feature Files of needed combination are stored in 'Data/'.
The classification of RevealDroid is done in RevealDroid.py, the default train_test split is 0.3, the result of classification can be found in 'ClassificationReport.txt' in 'Data/'
